# SmartAcademicManager

The Smart Academic Manager is a desktop-based application, created for the the CSE-2112 Object Oriented Programming lab project, using Java, JavaFX, and SQLite. It helps students manage daily academic tasks, including schedules, to-do lists, attendance, and course information, integrating all activities into a central database for ease of use.
